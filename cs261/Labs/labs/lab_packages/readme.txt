Overview
--------

For this lab you will explore how to use Java packages. You will write very
little code for this lab. In fact, you don't have to have the code you write
do anything, you just need to make it all compile.

Details
-------

Read through the RpgGame.java file. Notice that it refers to several different
classes in different packages. You need to add the appropriate classes (and
packages) in order to make the RpgGame.java compile without any errors or
warnings. You cannot modify RpgGame.java.

Turning in the assignment
-------------------------

Use jar to make a jar file of all of your java files and then use the turnin
program to turn in your jar file. The command is ~mike.noel/bin/turnin cs261
RpgGame.jar.
