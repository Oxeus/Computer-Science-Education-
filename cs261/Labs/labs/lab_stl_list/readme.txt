Overview
--------

For this lab you will create a simple C++ program that uses an STL List of integers.

Details
-------

The list.cpp file (included with the lab files) has the basic code to generate
a Fibonacci sequence. You need to modify the program to store the sequence in
an STL list and then print out the values. There are four places where you
need to add code and they are all indicated with comments.

Turning in the assignment
-------------------------

Use the turnin program to turn in your list.cpp file. The command is
~mike.noel/bin/turnin cs261 list.cpp
