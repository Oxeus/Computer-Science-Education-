Using the attached .cpp from lab, alter the function bodies of 

int R(int x, int y);
int G(int x, int y);
int B(int x, int y);

to create a pretty picture using any arithmetic operators that 
you think would be fun. Some examples of operators you could use
are +, -, *, /, %, sqrt, pow, etc. To see this picture, you will 
have  to correctly install and configure putty and xming (on PC) 
or use ssh -X in the terminal (on mac).

In the lab Dropbox in D2L, please do not submit your .cpp file;
.cpp files will get no credit. Rather, turn in a picture of the 
output of your code. You may use any reasonable graphics exentsion 
(.jpg, .png, .bmp, etc.). Have fun!!!
